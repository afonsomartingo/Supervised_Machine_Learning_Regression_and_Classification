## Repository Structure

- `data/`: Contains datasets used in the exercises
- `images/`: Supporting images for the notebooks
- `*.py` files: Utility functions and helper code
  - `lab_utils_uni.py`: Utilities for univariate analysis
  - `lab_utils_common.py`: Common utility functions
  - `plt_*.py`: Plotting utilities
  - `test_utils.py`: Testing utilities
  - `public_tests.py`: Public test cases
  - `utils.py`: General utility functions

## Setup and Requirements

To run these notebooks, you'll need:
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn
- TensorFlow (optional, for some advanced exercises)

## Style Configuration

The repository includes a custom Matplotlib style configuration (`deeplearning.mplstyle`) for consistent visualization across notebooks.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository
2. Install the required dependencies
3. Launch Jupyter Notebook in the repository directory
4. Open the notebooks in sequential order, starting with Week 1 labs

## Note

- The notebooks are named with the format `C1_Wx_*` where:
  - C1 represents Course 1
  - Wx represents Week x of the course
- Solution notebooks are marked with `_Soln` suffix
- Make sure to complete the labs in order as concepts build upon previous lessons
